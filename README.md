# DUNNE Project:

## Descritpion:
This repository shows some of the work I made as a part of the DUNNE project in collaboration with LORIA (a computer science research laboratory) and LEMTA (a physics research laboratory). The objective of my work was to predict multiple Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) curves from microstructure images of composite materials using AI. 

## Article: 
An article available in this repository provides a detailed description of the approach I employed to address this issue. It subsequently showcases and interprets the results I have achieved. The article currently serves as a preview of a preprint that will be submitted to ArXiv in October 2023.

## Dataset:
The dataset I used is not available in this repository, since I am not allowed to share it publicly. If you are interested in this dataset please contact Julien Boisse at julien.boisse@univ-lorraine.fr

## Code
A Jupyter Notebook file available in this repository provides some of the code I wrote for this project.

## Contributors
My work has been supervised by Julien Boisse, a researcher at LEMTA, as well as by Guenael Cabanes and Parisa Rastin, researchers at LORIA.
